## Data Structures Assignments
####Dijikstra's Algorithm
Minimum path problem: Read weigted routes from an input file and output generated for maximum and minimum time.
####Huffmans Algorithm<br>
Data Compression: utilizing Bitstreams, Frequency Tables and Priority Queues<br><br><br>
From the frequency table and using your priority queue, build the Huffman tree. You will be using one kind of tree (the heap) to build an entirely different kind of tree! 
####Treap Algorithm<br>
Word count problem implmented using __BST__ (Binary Search Tree) and dictionary (Key-Value Pair).
